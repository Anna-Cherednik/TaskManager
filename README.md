# TaskManager

Implement task manager with next functionality:
As a User I should be able to:

Register in a system;
Login into the system;
Add new task;
Edit task;
Delete task;

Share the task (share using email of another user in the system who will be also able to manage task afterwards )
See list of tasks ( list should auto-update when someone shares tasks with user; in the list, user should see who has shared task)
Use Twitter Bootstrap for UI. 
Cover code by tests.
